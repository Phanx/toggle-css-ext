# Toggle CSS

Browser extension to quickly enable or disable CSS in the current tab.

I couldn't find any addon that *just* did this, and did it thoroughly,
so I wrote one myself.

Tested in Firefox, Vivaldi, and Chromium. Should work in any browser
that supports Chrome extensions. Support for other browsers is *not*
planned, since I don't use any other browsers.
