# Toggle CSS

Browser extension to quickly enable or disable CSS in the current tab.

I've long missed this feature of Opera 12-, and couldn't find any modern
browser addon that *just* did this, and did it thoroughly, so here we are.

Zaps linked stylesheets, embedded stylesheets, and inline style attributes,
including inline styles added by scripts while CSS is disabled, all of
which are restored when CSS is re-enabled.


## TODO

- Persist state between page loads
- Monitor for style*sheets* added by scripts?
- Evaluate inclusion of `Ctrl-G` keybinding
- Publish on AMO and Chrome Web Store


## Browser Compatibility

Tested in Firefox, Vivaldi, and Chromium. Should work in any browser that
supports Chrome extensions. Support for other browsers is not planned,
since I don't use any other browsers.
